Feature: Calculator # features/my_features2.feature:1
  In order to avoid silly mistakes
  I want to be told the sum of two numbers
  Scenario: Add two numbers                                                             # features/my_features2.feature:5
    Given I have entered 5 into the calculator and I have entered 7 into the calculator # steps/my_steps2.py:3
    When I press add                                                                    # steps/my_steps2.py:8
    Then the result should be 12 on the screen                                          # steps/my_steps2.py:12
